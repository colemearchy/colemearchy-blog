![Make Thumbnail]

## Why a PM Became Obsessed with Automation

The most frustrating moment as a PM was **"when my time was stolen by repetitive tasks"**.

Every morning, pasting yesterday's metrics into Slack, moving new customer info to Google Sheets, copying emails to Notion... **"Why am I doing this manually?"**

I tried Zapier but it was too expensive. Then I discovered Make (formerly Integromat), and realized **"This is real automation"**.

## Why It's Great from a PM Perspective

### 1. "Team Productivity Automation"

**Automation Example: New Customer Onboarding**

**Traditional Process:**
1. Check payment in Stripe
2. Manually enter customer info into Google Sheets
3. Notify team in Slack
4. Send welcome email
5. Create customer document page in Notion

‚Üí **Time: 15 minutes/case**

**Make Automation:**
Stripe payment complete ‚Üí (auto) Add to Google Sheets ‚Üí (auto) Slack notification ‚Üí (auto) Send email ‚Üí (auto) Create Notion page

‚Üí **Time: 0 seconds (fully automated)**

### 2. "Build Data Pipelines"

**Case: Daily Metrics Report Automation**

**Scenario:**
1. Trigger at 9 AM daily
2. Extract data from Google Analytics API
3. Get user metrics from Mixpanel
4. Sum and calculate data
5. Send as nice table to Slack
6. Record in Google Sheets (save history)

**Result:** Report automatically waiting in Slack every morning

### 3. "Implement Complex Business Logic"

Zapier only allows simple A‚ÜíB automation, but Make supports:

- **Conditional branching**: "If amount ‚â• $100 then A, else B"
- **Iteration**: "Send email for each array item"
- **Data aggregation**: "Collect data from multiple sources to create one report"
- **Error handling**: "Retry on API failure, Slack notification after 3 failures"

### 4. "Focus PM Time on Strategy"

**Before automation:** 3 hours/day = repetitive tasks (copying data, notifications, reports)
**After automation:** 3 hours/day = strategy, customer interviews, product planning

## Actual Usage Review

- ‚≠ê Overwhelming price (1/10 of Zapier)
