## The Irony of Becoming a PM from Designer

When I worked as a designer, **"a full day wasn't enough for design work"**, but after becoming a PM, I faced the ironic situation of **"no time to design but having to review designs"**.

"How great would it be if I could quickly visualize ideas and show them to the team?"

When I first tried UX Pilot, honestly, I wondered, "Can AI really do proper UI design?" But actually... **it was a tool that allowed me to leverage my designer background**.

## Why It's Great from a PM Perspective

### 1. "Instant Mockups During Idea Meetings"

**Traditional Process:**
Meeting ‚Üí Write PRD ‚Üí Request to designer ‚Üí Wait 3 days ‚Üí Feedback ‚Üí Revise ‚Üí ...

**Using UX Pilot:**
During meeting ‚Üí "How about this screen?" ‚Üí **Generate mockup in 30 seconds** ‚Üí Immediate feedback ‚Üí On-the-spot revision

### 2. "Improved Communication with Designers"

"Make this screen kinda like this feel" (vague)

‚Üí "I made this with UX Pilot, is this the right direction?" (specific)

Designers immediately **"Ah, this is what you wanted"** understand.

### 3. "Rapid Prototyping"

Customer interviews ‚Üí Identify needs ‚Üí **Generate screens in 5 minutes with UX Pilot** ‚Üí Show in next interview

**Customer validation possible without design resources**.

### 4. "Maintain Designer Sensibility"

You can fine-tune AI-generated designs: **"More spacing", "Change color tone", "Adjust typo size"**.

With a designer background, I can immediately spot "what's off" in AI results. Just adjust it with prompts.

## Actual Usage Review

**Pros:**
- ‚≠ê Really fast (idea ‚Üí UI design in 30 seconds)
- ‚≠ê Perfect Figma integration (export and edit immediately)
- ‚≠ê Various style support (minimal, colorful, dark mode, etc.)

**Limitations:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex interactions have expression limits
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Credits deplete quickly (Pro plan recommended)
