## What I Realized Running YouTube as a PM

When I started running a YouTube channel as a PM, the biggest bottleneck was **"voice"**.

It was awkward speaking in front of the camera, and editing after recording took a lot of time. I thought, "Should I use AI voiceover?" but existing TTS sounded too robotic.

When I first tried ElevenLabs, honestly, I was shocked. It sounded **"Is this really not a human voice?"** so natural.
